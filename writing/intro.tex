Classification is important in all fields of science.  Some examples specific to astrophysics: classifying celestial objects based simply on the emission of light from the object, and often do so in an approximate way without having detailed observations of defining characteristics; classifying whether a transient dip in a star's brightness is due to a planet or another star crossing between us and the star; and classifying galaxies based on images.  Less grandiose but more useful, in this work I try to understand useful classifiers and parameters for sentiment classification of a given set of reviews.  Information from sentiment analysis of reviews can give companies valueable insights as to which of their products are most successful, as well as allow them to identify bad products and situations and focus resources towards mitigating fallout from the situation producing the negative reviews.

In this work, I investigate various classifiers and associated tools (e.g., feature selection) to figure out the best and most accurate classifiers.  Specifically, I look at X classifiers in this way and that way.  Bag-of-words.  Maybe speed.  Feature selection.
